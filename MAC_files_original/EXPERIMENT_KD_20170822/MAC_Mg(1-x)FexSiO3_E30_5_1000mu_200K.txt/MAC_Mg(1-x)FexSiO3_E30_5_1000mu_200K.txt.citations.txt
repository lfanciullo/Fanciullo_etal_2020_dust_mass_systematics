* SSHADE Data use policy
Data access and use are ruled by the SSHADE consortium data policy.

Any use of downloaded SSHADE data in a scientific or technical paper or a presentation is free but **you should cite both SSHADE and the used data** in the text (exactly as for normal papers: 'first author et al. (year)'). The full data reference, including its unique DOI identifier, should appear either in the main reference section of the paper or in a special 'data citation' section. When available, the original paper(s) presenting the data should be also cited. All these reference(s) are provided below.

The data citation is made at the level of the experiment containing one or more spectra, even if only one spectrum of the experiment is used in your paper (you can then specify which one(s) in the text).
